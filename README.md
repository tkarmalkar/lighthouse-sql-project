# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals


## Process
  Download the CSV files from Google drive on laptop. 
  Check the file headers and data in files by opening them one by one. 
  Created the tables in ecommerce database by using the headers as columns. 
  Import CSV files in the tables.
  Re-try the failed jobs by changing the datatypes.
  Run few queries to understand the data before heading towards assignment steps.


## Results
We can:
Report traffic to website based on origination (Country, City), traffic source (paid, organic)
Analyze user behaviour on site (time spent, pages visited)
Product performance (top selling products by quantity, revenue)

## Challenges 
Importing the data took longer than expected as the data was inconsistent with data types (example: date is stored as text)
Unable to define the relationship between tables in Postgre SQL

## Future Goals
Focus more on data cleaning and QA processes
Identify more analysis that can be derived based on the data
